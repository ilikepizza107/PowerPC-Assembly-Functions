# GCTRM Codes

These are GCTRM codes that use headers that are generated from the compiled source. If anything at a lower memory value than the header in the cm.bin would be added, all codes here would need to be adjusted.

Codes ike Input Buffer expect a header for each player. Codes like Big Head Mode expect 2 options next to each other, as it uses the first as context to get to the second.
